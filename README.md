# M-Fit
the M-Fit suite, a set of programs for testing and validating traffic controllers against the various ITE/AASHTO/NEMA ATC and Caltrans TEES 2009 standards
The M-Fit suite is a set of tests originally designed for evaluating Siemens ATC 5.2b and ATC 6.xcompliant engine boards.  It may also be of use on other manufacturers’ engine boards.The suite is designed to be used in three different ways.                                    First, it is a tool to permit bench testing andlong term environmental testing of controllers during the manufacturing process.  To support this, theM-Fit suite is easily scriptable with a consistent set of control options for iteration count, verbosity, andlogging.  In this way, groups of tests can be run in sequence or simultaneously, and the series of testsrepeated as needed or indefinitely.   Second, it is a tool for configuration and diagnostic testing of controllers that have failed manufacturingtests or have been returned from the field for repair.  In this situation the tests would typically be run byhand in verbose mode.                                  Finally, it is a tool to assist in validating compliance of the engine board against the ATC specifications.
